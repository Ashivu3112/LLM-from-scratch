(Though I rather thought it would\\nhave been Rome or Florence.)\\n\"The height of his glory\"--that was what the women called\\nit. I can hear Mrs. Gideon Thwing--his last Chicago sitter--\\ndeploring his unaccountable abdication. \"Of course it\\'s\\ngoing to send the value of my picture \\'way up; but I don\\'t\\nthink of that, Mr. Rickham--the loss to Arrt is all I think of.\"\\nThe word, on Mrs. Thwing\\'s lips, multiplied its _rs_ as\\nthough they were reflected in an endless vista of mirrors.\\nAnd it was not only the Mrs. Thwings who mourned. Had\\nnot the exquisite Hermia Croft, at the last Grafton Gallery\\nshow, stopped me before Gisburn\\'s \"Moon-dancers\" to say,\\nwith tears in her eyes: \"We shall not look upon its like\\nagain\"?\\nWell!--even through the prism of Hermia\\'s tears I felt able\\nto face the fact with equanimity. Poor Jack Gisburn! The\\nwomen had made him--it was fitting that they should mourn\\nhim. Among his own sex fewer regrets were heard, and in\\nhis own trade hardly a murmur. Professional jealousy?\\nPerhaps. If it were, the honour of the craft was vindicated\\nby little Claude Nutley, who, in all good faith, brought out\\nin the Burlington a very handsome \"obituary\" on Jack--one3 \\nof those showy articles stocked with random technicalities\\nthat I have heard (I won\\'t say by whom) compared to\\nGisburn\\'s painting. And so--his resolve being apparently\\nirrevocable--the discussion gradually died out, and, as Mrs.\\nThwing had predicted, the price of \"Gisburns\" went up.\\nIt was not till three years later that, in the course of a few\\nweeks\\' idling on the Riviera, it suddenly occurred to me to\\nwonder why Gisburn had given up his painting. On\\nreflection, it really was a tempting problem. To accuse his\\nwife would have been too easy--his fair sitters had been\\ndenied the solace of saying that Mrs. Gisburn had \"dragged\\nhim down.\" For Mrs. Gisburn--as such--had not existed till\\nnearly a year after Jack\\'s resolve had been taken. It might be\\nthat he had married her--since he liked his ease--because he\\ndidn\\'t want to go on painting; but it would have been hard\\nto prove that he had given up his painting because he had\\nmarried her.\\nOf course, if she had not dragged him down, she had\\nequally, as Miss Croft contended, failed to \"lift him up\"--\\nshe had not led him back to the easel. To put the brush into\\nhis hand again--what a vocation for a wife! But Mrs.\\nGisburn appeared to have disdained it--and I felt it might be\\ninteresting to find out why.\\nThe desultory life of the Riviera lends itself to such purely\\nacademic speculations; and having, on my way to Monte4 \\nCarlo, caught a glimpse of Jack\\'s balustraded terraces\\nbetween the pines, I had myself borne thither the next day.\\nI found the couple at tea beneath their palm-trees; and Mrs.\\nGisburn\\'s welcome was so genial that, in the ensuing\\nweeks, I claimed it frequently. It was not that my hostess\\nwas \"interesting\": on that point I could have given Miss\\nCroft the fullest reassurance. It was just because she was\\n_not_ interesting--if I may be pardoned the bull--that I\\nfound her so. For Jack, all his life, had been surrounded by\\ninteresting women: they had fostered his art, it had been\\nreared in the hot-house of their adulation. And it was\\ntherefore instructive to note what effect the \"deadening\\natmosphere of mediocrity\" (I quote Miss Croft) was having\\non him.\\nI have mentioned that Mrs. Gisburn was rich; and it was\\nimmediately perceptible that her husband was extracting\\nfrom this circumstance a delicate but substantial\\nsatisfaction. It is, as a rule, the people who scorn money\\nwho get most out of it; and Jack\\'s elegant disdain of his\\nwife\\'s big balance enabled him, with an appearance of\\nperfect good-breeding, to transmute it into objects of art and\\nluxury. To the latter, I must add, he remained relatively\\nindifferent; but he was buying Renaissance bronzes and\\neighteenth-century pictures with a discrimination that\\nbespoke the amplest resources.5 \\n\"Money\\'s only excuse is to put beauty into circulation,\" was\\none of the axioms he laid down across the Sevres and silver\\nof an exquisitely appointed luncheon-table, when, on a later\\nday, I had again run over from Monte Carlo; and Mrs.\\nGisburn, beaming on him, added for my enlightenment:\\n\"Jack is so morbidly sensitive to every form of beauty.\"\\nPoor Jack! It had always been his fate to have women say\\nsuch things of him: the fact should be set down in\\nextenuation. What struck me now was that, for the first\\ntime, he resented the tone. I had seen him, so often, basking\\nunder similar tributes--was it the conjugal note that robbed\\nthem of their savour? No--for, oddly enough, it became\\napparent that he was fond of Mrs. Gisburn--fond enough\\nnot to see her absurdity. It was his own absurdity he seemed\\nto be wincing under--his own attitude as an object for\\ngarlands and incense.\\n\"My dear, since I\\'ve chucked painting people don\\'t say that\\nstuff about me--they say it about Victor Grindle,\" was his\\nonly protest, as he rose from the table and strolled out onto\\nthe sunlit terrace.\\nI glanced after him, struck by his last word. Victor Grindle\\nwas, in fact, becoming the man of the moment--as Jack\\nhimself, one might put it, had been the man of the hour. The\\nyounger artist was said to have formed himself at my\\nfriend\\'s feet, and I wondered if a tinge of jealousy underlay\\nthe latter\\'s mysterious abdication. But no--for it was not till6 \\nafter that event that the _rose Dubarry_ drawing-rooms had\\nbegun to display their \"Grindles.\"\\nI turned to Mrs. Gisburn, who had lingered to give a lump\\nof sugar to her spaniel in the dining-room.\\n\"Why _has_ he chucked painting?\" I asked abruptly.\\nShe raised her eyebrows with a hint of good-humoured\\nsurprise.\\n\"Oh, he doesn\\'t _have_ to now, you know; and I want him\\nto enjoy himself,\" she said quite simply.\\nI looked about the spacious white-panelled room, with its\\n_famille-verte_ vases repeating the tones of the pale\\ndamask curtains, and its eighteenth-century pastels in\\ndelicate faded frames.\\n\"Has he chucked his pictures too? I haven\\'t seen a single\\none in the house.\"\\nA slight shade of constraint crossed Mrs. Gisburn\\'s open\\ncountenance. \"It\\'s his ridiculous modesty, you know. He\\nsays they\\'re not fit to have about; he\\'s sent them all away\\nexcept one--my portrait--and that I have to keep upstairs.\"\\nHis ridiculous modesty--Jack\\'s modesty about his pictures?\\nMy curiosity was growing like the bean-stalk. I said7 \\npersuasively to my hostess: \"I must really see your portrait,\\nyou know.\"\\nShe glanced out almost timorously at the terrace where her\\nhusband, lounging in a hooded chair, had lit a cigar and\\ndrawn the Russian deerhound\\'s head between his knees.\\n\"Well, come while he\\'s not looking,\" she said, with a laugh\\nthat tried to hide her nervousness; and I followed her\\nbetween the marble Emperors of the hall, and up the wide\\nstairs with terra-cotta nymphs poised among flowers at each\\nlanding.\\nIn the dimmest corner of her boudoir, amid a profusion of\\ndelicate and distinguished objects, hung one of the familiar\\noval canvases, in the inevitable garlanded frame. The mere\\noutline of the frame called up all Gisburn\\'s past!\\nMrs. Gisburn drew back the window-curtains, moved aside\\na _jardiniere_ full of pink azaleas, pushed an arm-chair\\naway, and said: \"If you stand here you can just manage to\\nsee it. I had it over the mantel-piece, but he wouldn\\'t let it\\nstay.\"\\nYes--I could just manage to see it--the first portrait of Jack\\'s\\nI had ever had to strain my eyes over! Usually they had the\\nplace of honour--say the central panel in a pale yellow or\\n_rose Dubarry_ drawing-room, or a monumental easel\\nplaced so that it took the light through curtains of old8 \\nVenetian point. The more modest place became the picture\\nbetter; yet, as my eyes grew accustomed to the half-light, all\\nthe characteristic qualities came out--all the hesitations\\ndisguised as audacities, the tricks of prestidigitation by\\nwhich, with such consummate skill, he managed to divert\\nattention from the real business of the picture to some pretty\\nirrelevance of detail. Mrs. Gisburn, presenting a neutral\\nsurface to work on--forming, as it were, so inevitably the\\nbackground of her own picture--had lent herself in an\\nunusual degree to the display of this false virtuosity. The\\npicture was one of Jack\\'s \"strongest,\" as his admirers would\\nhave put it--it represented, on his part, a swelling of\\nmuscles, a congesting of veins, a balancing, straddling and\\nstraining, that reminded one of the circus-clown\\'s ironic\\nefforts to lift a feather. It met, in short, at every point the\\ndemand of lovely woman to be painted \"strongly\" because\\nshe was tired of being painted \"sweetly\"--and yet not to lose\\nan atom of the sweetness.\\n\"It\\'s the last he painted, you know,\" Mrs. Gisburn said with\\npardonable pride. \"The last but one,\" she corrected herself--\\n\"but the other doesn\\'t count, because he destroyed it.\"\\n\"Destroyed it?\" I was about to follow up this clue when I\\nheard a footstep and saw Jack himself on the threshold.\\nAs he stood there, his hands in the pockets of his velveteen\\ncoat, the thin brown waves of hair pushed back from his\\nwhite forehead, his lean sunburnt cheeks furrowed by a9 \\nsmile that lifted the tips of a self-confident moustache, I felt\\nto what a degree he had the same quality as his pictures--the\\nquality of looking cleverer than he was.\\nHis wife glanced at him deprecatingly, but his eyes\\ntravelled past her to the portrait.\\n\"Mr. Rickham wanted to see it,\" she began, as if excusing\\nherself. He shrugged his shoulders, still smiling.\\n\"Oh, Rickham found me out long ago,\" he said lightly; then,\\npassing his arm through mine: \"Come and see the rest of the\\nhouse.\"\\nHe showed it to me with a kind of naive suburban pride: the\\nbath-rooms, the speaking-tubes, the dress-closets, the\\ntrouser-presses--all the complex simplifications of the\\nmillionaire\\'s domestic economy. And whenever my wonder\\npaid the expected tribute he said, throwing out his chest a\\nlittle: \"Yes, I really don\\'t see how people manage to live\\nwithout that.\"\\nWell--it was just the end one might have foreseen for him.\\nOnly he was, through it all and in spite of it all--as he had\\nbeen through, and in spite of, his pictures--so handsome, so\\ncharming, so disarming, that one longed to cry out: \"Be\\ndissatisfied with your leisure!\" as once one had longed to\\nsay: \"Be dissatisfied with your work!\"10 \\nBut, with the cry on my lips, my diagnosis suffered an\\nunexpected check.\\n\"This is my own lair,\" he said, leading me into a dark plain\\nroom at the end of the florid vista. It was square and brown\\nand leathery: no \"effects\"; no bric-a-brac, none of the air of\\nposing for reproduction in a picture weekly--above all, no\\nleast sign of ever having been used as a studio.\\nThe fact brought home to me the absolute finality of Jack\\'s\\nbreak with his old life.\\n\"Don\\'t you ever dabble with paint any more?\" I asked, still\\nlooking about for a trace of such activity.\\n\"Never,\" he said briefly.\\n\"Or water-colour--or etching?\"\\nHis confident eyes grew dim, and his cheeks paled a little\\nunder their handsome sunburn.\\n\"Never think of it, my dear fellow--any more than if I\\'d\\nnever touched a brush.\"\\nAnd his tone told me in a flash that he never thought of\\nanything else.\\nI moved away, instinctively embarrassed by my unexpected\\ndiscovery; and as I turned, my eye fell on a small picture1 1 \\nabove the mantel-piece--the only object breaking the plain\\noak panelling of the room.\\n\"Oh, by Jove!\" I said.\\nIt was a sketch of a donkey--an old tired donkey, standing\\nin the rain under a wall.\\n\"By Jove--a Stroud!\" I cried.\\nHe was silent; but I felt him close behind me, breathing a\\nlittle quickly.\\n\"What a wonder! Made with a dozen lines--but on\\neverlasting foundations. You lucky chap, where did you get\\nit?\"\\nHe answered slowly: \"Mrs. Stroud gave it to me.\"\\n\"Ah--I didn\\'t know you even knew the Strouds. He was\\nsuch an inflexible hermit.\"\\n\"I didn\\'t--till after. . . . She sent for me to paint him when he\\nwas dead.\"\\n\"When he was dead? You?\"\\nI must have let a little too much amazement escape through\\nmy surprise, for he answered with a deprecating laugh:\\n\"Yes--she\\'s an awful simpleton, you know, Mrs. Stroud. Her12 \\nonly idea was to have him done by a fashionable painter--\\nah, poor Stroud! She thought it the surest way of\\nproclaiming his greatness--of forcing it on a purblind\\npublic. And at the moment I was _the_ fashionable painter.\"\\n\"Ah, poor Stroud--as you say. Was _that_ his history?\"\\n\"That was his history. She believed in him, gloried in him--\\nor thought she did. But she couldn\\'t bear not to have all the\\ndrawing-rooms with her. She couldn\\'t bear the fact that, on\\nvarnishing days, one could always get near enough to see\\nhis pictures. Poor woman! She\\'s just a fragment groping for\\nother fragments. Stroud is the only whole I ever knew.\"\\n\"You ever knew? But you just said--\"\\nGisburn had a curious smile in his eyes.\\n\"Oh, I knew him, and he knew me--only it happened after\\nhe was dead.\"\\nI dropped my voice instinctively. \"When she sent for you?\"\\n\"Yes--quite insensible to the irony. She wanted him\\nvindicated--and by me!\"\\nHe laughed again, and threw back his head to look up at the\\nsketch of the donkey. \"There were days when I couldn\\'t\\nlook at that thing--couldn\\'t face it. But I forced myself to\\nput it here; and now it\\'s cured me--cured me. That\\'s the13 \\nreason why I don\\'t dabble any more, my dear Rickham; or\\nrather Stroud himself is the reason.\"\\nFor the first time my idle curiosity about my companion\\nturned into a serious desire to understand him better.\\n\"I wish you\\'d tell me how it happened,\" I said.\\nHe stood looking up at the sketch, and twirling between his\\nfingers a cigarette he had forgotten to light. Suddenly he\\nturned toward me.\\n\"I\\'d rather like to tell you--because I\\'ve always suspected\\nyou of loathing my work.\"\\nI made a deprecating gesture, which he negatived with a\\ngood-humoured shrug.\\n\"Oh, I didn\\'t care a straw when I believed in myself--and\\nnow it\\'s an added tie between us!\"\\nHe laughed slightly, without bitterness, and pushed one of\\nthe deep arm-chairs forward. \"There: make yourself\\ncomfortable--and here are the cigars you like.\"\\nHe placed them at my elbow and continued to wander up\\nand down the room, stopping now and then beneath the\\npicture.14 \\n\"How it happened? I can tell you in five minutes--and it\\ndidn\\'t take much longer to happen. . . . I can remember now\\nhow surprised and pleased I was when I got Mrs. Stroud\\'s\\nnote. Of course, deep down, I had always _felt_ there was\\nno one like him--only I had gone with the stream, echoed\\nthe usual platitudes about him, till I half got to think he was\\na failure, one of the kind that are left behind. By Jove, and\\nhe _was_ left behind--because he had come to stay! The\\nrest of us had to let ourselves be swept along or go under,\\nbut he was high above the current--on everlasting\\nfoundations, as you say.\\n\"Well, I went off to the house in my most egregious mood--\\nrather moved, Lord forgive me, at the pathos of poor\\nStroud\\'s career of failure being crowned by the glory of my\\npainting him! Of course I meant to do the picture for\\nnothing--I told Mrs. Stroud so when she began to stammer\\nsomething about her poverty. I remember getting off a\\nprodigious phrase about the honour being _mine_--oh, I\\nwas princely, my dear Rickham! I was posing to myself like\\none of my own sitters.\\n\"Then I was taken up and left alone with him. I had sent all\\nmy traps in advance, and I had only to set up the easel and\\nget to work. He had been dead only twenty-four hours, and\\nhe died suddenly, of heart disease, so that there had been no\\npreliminary work of destruction--his face was clear and\\nuntouched. I had met him once or twice, years before, and15 \\nthought him insignificant and dingy. Now I saw that he was\\nsuperb.\\n\"I was glad at first, with a merely aesthetic satisfaction:\\nglad to have my hand on such a \\'subject.\\' Then his strange\\nlife-likeness began to affect me queerly--as I blocked the\\nhead in I felt as if he were watching me do it. The sensation\\nwas followed by the thought: if he _were_ watching me,\\nwhat would he say to my way of working? My strokes\\nbegan to go a little wild--I felt nervous and uncertain.\\n\"Once, when I looked up, I seemed to see a smile behind his\\nclose grayish beard--as if he had the secret, and were\\namusing himself by holding it back from me. That\\nexasperated me still more. The secret? Why, I had a secret\\nworth twenty of his! I dashed at the canvas furiously, and\\ntried some of my bravura tricks. But they failed me, they\\ncrumbled. I saw that he wasn\\'t watching the showy bits--I\\ncouldn\\'t distract his attention; he just kept his eyes on the\\nhard passages between. Those were the ones I had always\\nshirked, or covered up with some lying paint. And how he\\nsaw through my lies!\\n\"I looked up again, and caught sight of that sketch of the\\ndonkey hanging on the wall near his bed. His wife told me\\nafterward it was the last thing he had done--just a note taken\\nwith a shaking hand, when he was down in Devonshire\\nrecovering from a previous heart attack. Just a note! But it\\ntells his whole history. There are years of patient scornful16 \\npersistence in every line. A man who had swum with the\\ncurrent could never have learned that mighty up-stream\\nstroke. . . .\\n\"I turned back to my work, and went on groping and\\nmuddling; then I looked at the donkey again. I saw that,\\nwhen Stroud laid in the first stroke, he knew just what the\\nend would be. He had possessed his subject, absorbed it,\\nrecreated it. When had I done that with any of my things?\\nThey hadn\\'t been born of me--I had just adopted them. . . .\\n\"Hang it, Rickham, with that face watching me I couldn\\'t do\\nanother stroke. The plain truth was, I didn\\'t know where to\\nput it--_I had never known_. Only, with my sitters and my\\npublic, a showy splash of colour covered up the fact--I just\\nthrew paint into their faces. . . . Well, paint was the one\\nmedium those dead eyes could see through--see straight to\\nthe tottering foundations underneath. Don\\'t you know how,\\nin talking a foreign language, even fluently, one says half\\nthe time not what one wants to but what one can? Well--that\\nwas the way I painted; and as he lay there and watched me,\\nthe thing they called my \\'technique\\' collapsed like a house\\nof cards. He didn\\'t sneer, you understand, poor Stroud--he\\njust lay there quietly watching, and on his lips, through the\\ngray beard, I seemed to hear the question: \\'Are you sure you\\nknow where you\\'re coming out?\\'\\n\"If I could have painted that face, with that question on it, I\\nshould have done a great thing. The next greatest thing was17 \\nto see that I couldn\\'t--and that grace was given me. But, oh,\\nat that minute, Rickham, was there anything on earth I\\nwouldn\\'t have given to have Stroud alive before me, and to\\nhear him say: \\'It\\'s not too late--I\\'ll show you how\\'?\\n\"It _was_ too late--it would have been, even if he\\'d been\\nalive. I packed up my traps, and went down and told Mrs.\\nStroud. Of course I didn\\'t tell her _that_--it would have\\nbeen Greek to her. I simply said I couldn\\'t paint him, that I\\nwas too moved. She rather liked the idea--she\\'s so romantic!\\nIt was that that made her give me the donkey. But she was\\nterribly upset at not getting the portrait--she did so want\\nhim \\'done\\' by some one showy! At first I was afraid she\\nwouldn\\'t let me off--and at my wits\\' end I suggested\\nGrindle. Yes, it was I who started Grindle: I told Mrs.\\nStroud he was the \\'coming\\' man, and she told somebody\\nelse, and so it got to be true. . . . And he painted Stroud\\nwithout wincing; and she hung the picture among her\\nhusband\\'s things. . . .\"\\nHe flung himself down in the arm-chair near mine, laid\\nback his head, and clasping his arms beneath it, looked up\\nat the picture above the chimney-piece.\\n\"I like to fancy that Stroud himself would have given it to\\nme, if he\\'d been able to say what he thought that day.\"\\nAnd, in answer to a question I put half-mechanically--\\n\"Begin again?\" he flashed out. \"When the one thing that18 \\nbrings me anywhere near him is that I knew enough to leave\\noff?\"\\nHe stood up and laid his hand on my shoulder with a laugh.\\n\"Only the irony of it is that I _am_ still painting--since\\nGrindle\\'s doing it for me! The Strouds stand alone, and\\nhappen once--but there\\'s no exterminating our kind of art.\"19 \\nThis work is in the public domain in\\nthe United States because it was\\npublished before January 1, 1929.\\nThis work may be in the public\\ndomain in countries and areas with\\nlonger native copyright terms that\\napply the rule of the shorter term to\\nforeign works.\\n20 21 \\nAbout this digital edition\\nThis e-book comes from the online library Wikisource.
